# How can you help?

- add a main to exercises that are only functions
- add new exercises ([sample](https://github.com/fwuensche/42-exam-miner/pull/1/files))
- reorganize exercises in its corresponding level
- improve solutions by:
  - better naming variables and functions
  - being rather explicit then implicit (for instance, avoid one-liners)
  - catching bugs ([sample](https://github.com/fwuensche/42-exam-miner/pull/2/files))
  - proposing your own solution as an alternative ([sample](https://github.com/fwuensche/42-exam-miner/pull/3/files))
