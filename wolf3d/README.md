## Wolf3D project
## Task:
- Create a 3D graphically “realistic” representation that we could have from inside a maze in a subjective view. Create this representation using the Ray-Casting principles.
- No matter the size and the shape of your labyrinth, but it has to be a file outside of your sources. Your evaluator should have the possibility to modify it without recompiling the whole project.
- The management of your window must remain smooth: passing over of another window, minimization, etc.
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
- Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit
the program cleanly.
- The arrows on the keyboard must allow you to move in real time in the maze, like in the original game.
- Display different wall textures (the choice is yours) that vary depending on which compass point the wall is facing (North, South, East, West).
